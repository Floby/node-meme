# Inspiration
This idea of this project came up after I read
[this](https://github.com/blog/818-github-reflog-v1-3-21) github blog post.
The [CLI Ruby Script](https://github.com/drbrain/meme) for generating memes
caught my attention but being an Ubuntu user, I couldn't get ruby to work
properly or even gem to compile native extensions. After wasting 1h30 of
my time, installing emacs without my knowledge, and ripping out my grub
when apt-get removing ruby, I decided to rewrite it so that I can one day
make it work. My favourite toy at the moment is [node.js](http://github.com/joyent/node).

So my bet is to rewrite this in less than 150 lines and to be able to
actually run it easily ; node.js as very few dependencies and 
[npm](http://npmjs.org) is just the best (easy when compared to gem)

# Description
Big Thanks to [drbrain](http://github.com/drbrain) and contributors to
[meme](http://github.com/drbrain/meme) from whom I took everything that
works.

Generate meme images using http://memegenerator.net!  Save yourself some time!

# Features/Problems
* Features many popular memes
* no tests

# Example
Generate a Y U NO meme:
	$ meme Y_U_NO 'write tests?'

See a list of available generators:

You can also drive it like an API:

# Requirements
* [node](http://nodejs.org)
* [npm](http://npmjs.org) is a big plus. It will make your life bearable

# Install
